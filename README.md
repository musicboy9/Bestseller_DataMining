# Standing the test of time: What makes a book survive on the best-seller list?

Undergraduate project from "Data Mining" lecture at SNU

Keywords: Text mining, Topic modeling

Aug. 2020 - Feb. 2021

- Analyzed the best-seller list of books on Amazon on a long time scale to find out the factor that makes a best-seller into a steady-seller.
- Collected various types of data such as genres, user reviews, and authors' information to apply topic modelling. As a result, the higher the top ranking and the lower the entry ranking on the best-seller list, the longer the book stayed on the list.
- Took part in crawling and parsing data from Amazon's annual best-seller lists.
